    Args:
        time_attr (str): The training result attr to use for comparing time.
            Note that you can pass in something non-temporal such as
            `training_iteration` as a measure of progress, the only requirement
            is that the attribute should increase monotonically.
        metric (str): The training result objective value attribute. As
            with `time_attr`, this may refer to any objective value. Stopping
            procedures will use this attribute.
        max_t (int): max time units per trial. Trials will be stopped after
            max_t time units (determined by time_attr) have passed.
            The scheduler will terminate trials after this time has passed.
            Note that this is different from the semantics of `max_t` as
            mentioned in the original HyperBand paper.
        mode (str): One of {min, max}. Determines whether objective is
                minimizing or maximizing the metric attribute.
